# Preamp

## Overview
The Preamp for the IICPP has two switchable modes, Clean and Lead. There are also various Pull-Potentiometer/Switch Activated modes for tone shaping. 
It's important to note that the Tone Stack for the IICPP comes after the First Gain Stage, and before all the Following Gain Stages.
An optional mod for the IICPP is the "C++" Mod, which adds a little bit more gain on tap. This is an optional mod, but also switchable when implemented.
There are two versions of the Preamp here, one which has Reverb (R) and one with No Reverb (NR). the Reverb, when implemented, is footswitchable. The No Reverb version uses one less 12AX7 Preamp Tube, and uses fewer components as well.
The rest of the components and the schematic are the same.
