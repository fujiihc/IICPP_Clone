# IICPP_Clone
Mark IIC+/++ Inspired Clone

## Overview
This goal of this project was to create a reasonably accurate "clone" of the Mesa Boogie Mark IIC+/++ Tube Amplifier. 
I was inspired by my love of Metallica and James Hetfield's rhythm playing, as well as my fascination with audio electronics.

These amplifiers can be considered legendary and are the subject of many discussions on what makes them so special and highly sought after.
Although a legitimate Mark IIC+ Reissue exists, as do many originals, these amps are often expensive, and vary in their component and feature choices.
I wouldn't consider this version to be a faithful clone as there is not much accurate, detailed information on these amplifiers, and some of the schematics that are available have been noted to be incorrect. Certain components are also not readily available today, and so some design concessions have to be made. Modifications due to limited design information, component availability, limited budget, and design complexity were made. However, the core DNA and design choices of the original were followed as closely as possible.
By having a more accessible, afforable, and reasonably accurate version, hopefully I can help contribute to others' tone chasing journeys, or help demystify (in some capacity) what makes these amps so special.

I currently do not own any Mesa Boogie amplifiers to base these designs off of. Instead, I have researched this amp in depth, scouring the internet for schematics, gut shots, and getting advice from others who have successfully built their own clones or similar amplifiers. 

A major goal of this project is to stay under a budget of $1800 (Half the price of a Reissue).

An important note, this project is for educational purposes and personal use only, and this repository is for documenting my learning progress and findings. I have no affiliation with Mesa Boogie or any sort of company or anything like that. I just like making stuff and playing guitar. Please don't sue me :)

## Thank You's
The following people have been invaluable in the progress of this project, both directly and indirectly. Whether they posted schematics that they traced, or in-depth gut shots or photos of their own builds, or even answered my questions when I ran into roadblocks, I would like to thank them. I wouldn't have made this much progress without them:
