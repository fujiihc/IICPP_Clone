# Power Supply

## Overview
The Power Supply for the IICPP contains the Main HT/B+ Taps as well as the Bias and Graphic EQ Power Supplies.

The board supports x2 (for 60W) and x4 (for 100W and Simul-Class) 300V 220uF Reservoir Caps.

## Status
  - Schematic, PCB Design, and Gerber for V1.0 of the Power Supply Board are Complete.
  - Gerbers generated for JLCPCB Manufacturing.

## Bill Of Materials
  - [Link to Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZE0vuGfygjLFiTaHai0WybOM6v7LY0qXNIPXHzz1JHo/edit?gid=810989497#gid=810989497)

## Notes
  - Bias Supply for SLOCLONE/DANO, Mesa Boogie, and JRB32 Schematics are incorrect. The correct Bias Supply Schematic is used in this V1.0, which was traced from original IIB and IIC+ Power Supply Boards.
  - Bias Supply Validated [Here](https://boogieforum.com/threads/iic-tune-up-and-restoration-updated.68183/)
  - Correct and Incorrect Bias Supply Versions can be found in [Experiments](../Experiments)
    
## To-Do/Future Plans
  - Add/Remove Taps based on Power Transformer. Currently looking at Hammond 291ZZ.
