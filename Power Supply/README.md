# Power Supply

## Overview
The Power Supply for the IICPP contains the Main HT/B+ Taps as well as the Bias and Graphic EQ Power Supplies.

The board supports x2 and x4 300V 220uF Reservoir Caps, as the number differs between the 60W, 100W, and Simul-Class versions.

## Status
  - Schematic, PCB Design, and Gerber for V1.0 of the Power Supply Board are Complete.
  - Gerbers generated for JLCPCB Manufacturing.

## Bill Of Materials
  - [Link to Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZE0vuGfygjLFiTaHai0WybOM6v7LY0qXNIPXHzz1JHo/edit?gid=810989497#gid=810989497)

## Notes
  - Bias Supply for V1.0 is traced from an Original IIB underside PCB. There are variations on the Bias Supply in the [Experiments](./Experiments) Folder.
  - More research will be done on the II, IIA, IIB, IIC+, etc Bias Supplies to find a general consensus.
    
## To-Do/Future Plans
  - Validate Bias Supply
  - Add/Remove Taps based on Power Transformer. Currently looking at Hammond 291ZZ.
